<P style="margin-top:-30px;">Vulnerability is a system susceptibility or flaw. Vulnerabilities of a Computer System can be exploited by those wishing to steal data or harm the system. 
<br><br>
Besides vulnerability, cyber-criminals may also resort to other methods to harm or steal information, or to even mentally and psychologically harm or harass the owner of the machine. Some such methods are given below.

      <h2>Viruses</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>A virus is a malware that, when executed, replicates by copying its own source code or infecting other computer programs by modifying them. Infecting computer programs can include as well, data files, or the "boot" sector of the hard drive. 
<br>
      <br>
      When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.
<br><br>
Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing private information (e.g., credit card numbers), corrupting data, displaying political or humorous messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless.

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Spamming is the use of electronic messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (spam), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. 
<br></br>
      While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam. </p>

      <h2>Phishing</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.</p>
      <p>Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Communications purporting to be from social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators are often used to lure victims. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.

      <h2>Trojan Horse</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>In computing, Trojan horse, or Trojan, is any malicious computer program which is used to hack into a computer by misleading users of its true intentions. </p>
      <p>Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an e-mail attachment disguised to be unsuspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by drive-by download. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. This infection allows an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity (IP address).
</p>
<p>Unlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.

      <p>Eavesdropping is secretly listening to the private conversation of others without their consent - The practice is commonly believed to be unethical.</p>
      <p>
     Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small packets from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers.

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Email fraud is the intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual through email. Almost as soon as email became widely used, it began to be used as a means to defraud people. Email fraud can take the form of a "con game" or scam.</p>
      <p>Confidence tricks tend to exploit the inherent greed and dishonesty of their victims. The prospect of a 'bargain' or 'something for nothing' can be very tempting. Email fraud, as with other 'bunco schemes' usually targets naive individuals who put their confidence in get-rich-quick schemes such as 'too good to be true' investments or offers to sell popular items at 'impossibly low' prices. Many people have lost their life savings due to fraud.</p>
